# Note Learn!

A useful open-source terminal game (soon to be web app) that lets you  
test and improve your ear.

## About the project:
- A simple, fun project meant to help me and others improve their musical skills 🔥  
- Made by SuperNinjaCat5

## As of now:
- Two Modes:  
  1. A simple quiz mode  
  2. A simple learn mode  
- Terminal based  
- No global variables (I think, I hope)  
- Only Windows (until website drops)  

## For the future:
- Plans to make into a website.
